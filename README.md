## Overview

Deep neural networks (DNNs) of various architectures have become dominantly used in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which roughly can be classified into two approaches - the DNN-HMM hybrid and the end-to-end (E2E) approaches. DNN-HMM hybrid systems like [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/) and [RASR](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/rwth-asr/) achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of recognition accuracy, usually measured by word error rate (WER) or character error rate (CER). End-to-end systems[^e2e] (like [Eesen](https://github.com/yajiemiao/eesen) and [Espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)) put simplicity of the training pipeline at a higher priority and usually are data-hungry. When comparing the hybrid and E2E approaches (modularity versus a single neural network, separate optimization versus joint optimization), it is worthwhile to note the pros and cons of each approach, as described in [2].

CAT aims at combining the advantages of the two kinds of ASR systems. CAT advocates discriminative training in the framework of [conditional random field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field) (CRF), particularly with but not limited to [connectionist temporal classification]() (CTC) inspired state topology.

The recently developed [CTC-CRF](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ouzhijian/pdf/ctc-crf.pdf) (namely CRF with CTC topology)  has achieved superior benchmarking performance with training data ranging from ~100 to ~1000 hours, while being end-to-end with simplified pipeline and being data-efficient in the sense that cheaply available language models (LMs) can be leveraged effectively with or without a pronunciation lexicon.

[^e2e]: End-to-end is in the sense that flat-start training of a single DNN in one stage, without using any previously trained models, forced alignments, or building state-tying decision trees, with or without a pronunciation lexicon.

## Key Features

1. **CAT contains a full-fledged implementation of CTC-CRF.** 
   * A non-trivial issue is that the gradient in training CRFs is the difference between *empirical expectation* and *model expectation*, which both can be efficiently calculated by the forward-backward algorithm.
   * CAT modifies [warp-ctc](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc) for fast parallel calculation of the *empirical expectation*, which resembles the CTC forward-backward calculation.
   * CAT calculates the *model expectation* using CUDA C/C++ interface, drawing inspiration from Kaldi's implementation of denominator forward-backward calculation.

2. **CAT adopts PyTorch to build DNNs and do automatic gradient computation, and so inherits the power of PyTorch in handling DNNs.**

3. **CAT provides a complete workflow for CRF-based end-to-end speech recognition.**
   * CAT provides complete training and testing scripts for a number of Chinese and English benchmarks and all the experimental results reported in this paper can be readily reproduced. 
   * Detailed documentation and code comments are also provided in CAT, making it easy to get start and obtain state-of-the-art baseline results even for beginners of ASR.

4. **Evaluation results on major benchmarks such as Switchboard and Aishell show that CAT obtains the state-of-the-art results among existing end-to-end models with less parameters, and is competitive compared with the hybrid DNN-HMM models.**

5. **We add the support of streaming ASR**. To this end, we propose a new method called contextualized soft forgetting (CSF), which combines soft forgetting and context-sensitive-chunk in bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). With contextualized soft forgetting, the chunk BLSTM based CTC-CRF with a latency of 300ms outperforms the whole-utterance BLSTM based CTC-CRF.
