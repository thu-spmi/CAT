class SimuNet(nn.Module):
    """This class defines Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC), a model that
    learns to extract general speech features from unlabeled speech data. These
    features are shown to contain rich speaker and phone information, and are
    useful for a wide range of downstream tasks such as speaker verification
    and phone classification.
    An APC model consists of a Prenet (optional), a multi-layer GRU network,
    and a Postnet. For each time step during training, the Prenet transforms
    the input frame into a latent representation, which is then consumed by
    the GRU network for generating internal representations across the layers.
    Finally, the Postnet takes the output of the last GRU layer and attempts to
    predict the target frame.
    After training, to extract features from the data of your interest, which
    do not have to be i.i.d. with the training data, simply feed-forward the
    the data through the APC model, and take the the internal representations
    (i.e., the GRU hidden states) as the extracted features and use them in
    your tasks.
